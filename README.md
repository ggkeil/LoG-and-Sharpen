# LoG-and-Sharpen
# Run the LoG_and_Sharpen.py file in Anaconda prompt. First, change directory to the folder with the python file. Then, type "python LoG_and_Sharpen.py -i 'imagefilename' " to begin filtering an image. The code will ask you to input a sigma and size for the Gaussian filter as well as a value for c which controls the sharpening. There are input images I have provided for you to play with.
